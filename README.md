# Gradient Descent Optimization

Welcome to the Gradient Descent Optimization repository! This project explores the implementation of the Gradient Descent algorithm for optimizing predictive models in Python.

## Overview

Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimization technique used extensively in machine learning and data science. It iteratively adjusts model parameters to minimize a cost function, thereby enhancing model accuracy and efficiency. This repository demonstrates the application of Gradient Descent in a straightforward example using synthetic data.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Core programming language for implementation.
- **NumPy**: Essential for efficient numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: Utilized for data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Provided for interactive experimentation and visualization.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to showcase:
- **Implementation**: Step-by-step implementation of Gradient Descent.
- **Visualization**: Visual representation of algorithmic outputs.
- **Educational Resource**: Serve as an educational resource for understanding Gradient Descent.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gradient-descent-optimization.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
